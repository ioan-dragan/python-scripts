The scripts from this folder are used in order to generate statistics from Vampire output files. statCasc.py generates statistics from output casc files. 

./statCasc.py folderWithStats/ Output.tex 

it takes as input a folder containig statistics organized in subfolders ending with .RES. eg: ioan/results/A1.RES ...
and each .RES folder contains output from different strategies. One file per problem and per strategy. Currently the script generates statistics for 
5 strategies. 

eg: in the folder A1.RES we have : AGT016+1.p.0 AGT016+1.p.1 AGT016+1.p.2 AGT016+1.p.3 AGT016+1.p.4   
than we get stats from these five files. Not other ones. Just this. Note it is important that the file ends with the strategy number [0:5]

./statDefault.py folderWithStats/ output.tex 

- same constraints as before. 

./splitLog.py . Assuming one has multiple program output from one strategy in a single file (CASC only) this script splits it in multiple files.
